                    My name is Nathan and I'm a college graduate from California. I majored in Computer Science and received
                    my Bachelor's degree in May, 2023.
                    As you can probably tell, I like cats. They're just pretty cool fuzzy creatures. I personally have one
                    cat because while they are cool
                    little creatures, I have to be responsible for their wellbeing and having one cat is all I could
                    comfortably manage.

                it. It's mostly just
                random stuff though, so don't think too much about it.

            <h2>My Journey to web development</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content corners">
            <p>
                My journey to web development has been a long one. I started going to college in spring 2018
                at the time, I wasn't too certain whether or not the tech industry was right for me. As I began taking
                courses in Computer Science and really enjoying the subject, that's when I knew. For me, building
                programs and website using code felt a lot like playing with legos. Creating classes, methods,
                functions,
                and dividing webpages all felt like taking each individual lego and building something cool with it.
                5 long years later I finally graduated and now I'm taking this course with C1 in hopes that it'll help
                me
                when it comes to expanding my network, finding job opportunities, and overall improving my skillset.
